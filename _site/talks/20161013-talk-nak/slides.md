# Background

##

### Sleep: *Slow-Wave Sleep* (SWS)

Since the second-order headers act as slide titles, 
BUT since they are

1. same size as first-order headers, which are HUGE, and
2. in all caps (???)

You can instead create a slide with an "empty" title via a blank second-order
header, and then use something smaller like a fourth-order header to fake the
title of the slide
