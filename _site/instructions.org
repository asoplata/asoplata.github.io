* instructions for workin on wurbsite
** Arch install locally (do NOT use sudo for any ruby!)
*** apparently, despite Jekyll saying "use ruby 2.7 or higher" does NOT mean it works on ruby 3, which is currently does not (as of 20211006)
*** from https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=265534
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -Suy ruby2.7
  # do not use gems
  cd <WURBSITE>
  bundle-2.7 install
  bundle-2.7 exec jekyll serve
  #+end_src
** serve using
#+begin_src shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
#+end_src

** jekyll howtos
*** very helpful! http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/ and https://ncmiller.github.io/2014/08/24/creating-jekyll-blog/ really just searching for jekyll website howtos is awesome
*** Jekyll or Poole? -specific things
**** appears you can program hrefs, or anything, that are defined in '_config.yml' e.g. via `<link href="{{ site.url }}/"/>` or just put {{ site.title }} straight in html
*** see http://downtothewire.io/2015/08/15/configuring-jekyll-for-user-and-project-github-pages/ for best practices
** Ubuntu serve page locally
*** if starting from scratch, install bundle via `gem install bundler`
*** also, make sure 'ruby-dev' package installed for updating/building
**** also maybe 'ruby-pkg-config' ?
**** nokogiri-1.8.1 needs package 'zlib1g-dev'
*** also need libgdbm-compat-dev for package dbm
*** if reinstalling again, follow https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu and run
`gem install jekyll bundler`
*** update regularly with
`gem update`
`bundle update`
*** then serve locally on 4000 with
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
