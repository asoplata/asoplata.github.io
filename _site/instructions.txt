- if starting from scratch, install bundle via `gem install bundler`
- also, make sure 'ruby-dev' package installed for updating/building
    - also maybe 'ruby-pkg-config' ?
    - nokogiri-1.8.1 needs package 'zlib1g-dev'

- if can't run bundle, try updating RubyGems (not ruby) with 

`sudo gem update --system`

- Note: if on office, switch to /bin/bash to ruby
- update regularly with

`gem update`

(especially the github-pages gem) then

`bundle update`

- serve locally on 4000 with

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

- very helpful! http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/ and https://ncmiller.github.io/2014/08/24/creating-jekyll-blog/ really just searching for jekyll website howtos is awesome

- Jekyll or Poole? -specific things
  - appears you can program hrefs, or anything, that are defined in '_config.yml' e.g. via `<link href="{{ site.url }}/"/>` or just put {{ site.title }} straight in html
- see http://downtothewire.io/2015/08/15/configuring-jekyll-for-user-and-project-github-pages/ for best practices
