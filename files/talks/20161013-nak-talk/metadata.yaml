    Sleep is characterized by unique patterns of cortical activity alternating
    between the stages of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep.
    How these patterns relate to the balanced activity of excitatory pyramidal
    cells and inhibitory interneu- rons in cortical circuits is unknown. We
    investigated cortical network activity during wakefulness, SWS, and REM sleep
    globally and locally using in vivo cal- cium imaging in mice. Wide-field
    imaging revealed a reduction in pyramidal cell activity during SWS compared
    with wakefulness and, unexpectedly, a further profound reduction in activity
    during REM sleep. Two-photon imaging on local circuits showed that this
    suppression of activity during REM sleep was accompanied by activation of
    parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons, but not of somatostatin (SOM)+ interneurons.
    PV+ interneurons most active during wakefulness were also most active during
    REM sleep. Our results reveal a sleep-stage-specific regu- lation of the
    cortical excitation/inhibition balance, with PV+ interneurons conveying maximum
    inhibi- tion during REM sleep, which might help shape memories in these
    networks.
