I've finally, after years of accumulating notes (in org-mode, natch), published 
the first edition of everything I can find on [Open 
Science](https://github.com/asoplata/open-science-resources) and [Open 
Computational 
Neuroscience](https://github.com/asoplata/open-computational-neuroscience-resources)! 
They seem like such tiny little things, but they represent small, meaningful 
victories to me for getting off my bum and finally starting something I've been 
planning to start for a VERY long time.
