OMG My first paper is out!!! Not that anyone reads this, but still (even though
it came out months ago)! Since it's open access, you can download it directly
from the [Publications page](/publications) or [go to the paper directly on PLoS
Computational
Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005879).
