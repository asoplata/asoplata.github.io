This is the code for Github Pages' hosting of Austin Soplata's website. This was "soft-forked" (aka copied over) from the excellent theme and system at https://academicpages.github.io/ .

1. Set site-wide configuration and add your content.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.
