I'm currently a post-doc at the [Neuroscience Statistics Research Lab](https://www.neurostat.mit.edu/)
at MIT and am employed by [Massachusetts General
Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/). I work under [Emery
N. Brown](https://hst.mit.edu/faculty-research/faculty/brown-emery) and [Nancy
Kopell](http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/) in order to investigate how anesthesia
enables loss of consciousness. I do this through the classic
[computational
neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) method
of simulating
[Hodgkin-Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkinâ€“Huxley_model) neural
networks, focusing on [thalamocortical
oscillations](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Thalamocortical_oscillations)
in particular. This
allows us to non-invasively probe how the cell- and synapse-specific effects of anesthetics like
[propofol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol) can change both your
consciousness and your brain's EEG, producing [fascinating dynamics of interacting
oscillations](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/3/839.long). These brain
rhythms resemble sleep activity in some ways, [but are very different in other ways!](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005879)

I'm also very interested in how these same thalamocortical networks contribute to
[memory consolidation in (mostly) sleep using oscillations of similar frequencies to
those of
anesthesia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Thalamocortical_oscillations#Sleep_spindle_oscillations),
via the co-occurrence of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples with thalamic spindles
and thalamocortical slow wave oscillations. The neuroscience of memory is a very
active field of research, but the role of sleep in memory has not been studied
as much and is likely ripe for discoveries. There's never enough time to
investigate all the directions that are exciting!

I believe the future of science is open science, on a personal, ethical, and
practical level. Frankly, though it may surprise you, computational neuroscience
has some catching up to do in this department, though it is improving rapidly. I
feel very strongly about open-sourcing all the tools, code, and parameters I use to perform
this work.

Neural networks in the brain are complicated, messy, and diverse. Simulating
them to uncover their fundamental mechanisms is fascinating, requiring both
rigorous attention-to-detail and flexibility at the same time. For neuroscience,
the vast majority of our work lies ahead of us, despite what it may seem like at
times.
